Head of the *Data Engineer & Computing program* at [CRS4 Biosciences](http://www.crs4.it/research/biosciences/) sector.  
I am involved in the development of the [CRS4 data-intensive computing infrastructure](http://next.crs4.it) for processing large scale biological data, lead developer of [Orione](/projects/orione) and technical coordinator for CRS4 at the Italian Node of [ELIXIR](http://elixir-italy.org/en).

My current interests are mainly focused on the elaboration of a comprehensive approach to support the data management and  integration, the processes traceability and the reliable  analysis of massive biological data, enabling the seamless integration of clinical and experimental data.

I earned my degree in Electronic Engineering at the [University of Cagliari](https://www.unica.it) in 2006.
