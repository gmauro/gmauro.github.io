Member of the​ [Freiburg Galaxy Team](https://galaxyproject.eu/freiburg){:target="_self"}, one of the leading groups within the worldwide [https://galaxyproject.org](Galaxy project). Currently working on the development of the [UseGalaxy.EU](https://usegalaxy.eu) infrastructure, the European UseGalaxy server.  
Previously, I supervised the implementation of the [CRS4 data-intensive computing infrastructure](http://next.crs4.it) for processing large scale biological data, led the development of [Orione](/projects/orione) (one of the first public Galaxy instances in Italy), and served as technical coordinator for CRS4 at the Italian Node of [ELIXIR](http://elixir-italy.org/en).

My current interests are mainly focused on the elaboration of a comprehensive approach to support the data management and  integration, the processes' 
traceability and the reproducible analysis of massive biological data, enabling the seamless integration of clinical and experimental data.

I earned my degree in Electronic Engineering at the [University of Cagliari](https://www.unica.it) in 2006.
